# Transcribo (Frontend)

![Transcribo Screenshot](_imgs/Transcribo.png)

Transcribo is a modern web application for audio and video transcription with advanced editing capabilities. Built with Nuxt.js and TypeScript, it provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, editing, and managing transcriptions with timeline-based visualization. This repository contains only the frontend code; the backend is written in Python FastAPI and available at [https://github.com/DCC-BS/transcribo-backend](https://github.com/DCC-BS/transcribo-backend).

## Setup

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the required environment variables:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:8000
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure to install dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
bun run dev
```

For debugging with inspector:

```bash
bun run debug
```

### Backend Setup

Create a `.env.backend` file in the root directory with the required environment variables:

```
HF_AUTH_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
```

> **Note:** The `HF_AUTH_TOKEN` is required for Hugging Face API access. You can create a token [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

Start the backend as a Docker container:

```bash
sudo docker compose up --build
```

Alternative clone the backend repository [transcribo-backend](https://github.com/DCC-BS/transcribo-backend) and run it locally.

## Testing & Linting

Run tests with Vitest:

```bash
# Run tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test:watch

# Generate coverage report
bun test:coverage
```

Format code with Biome:

```bash
bun run lint
```

Check and fix code issues:

```bash
bun run check
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

Generate static site:

```bash
bun run generate
```

Preview production build:

```bash
bun run preview
```

## Docker Deployment

The application includes a multi-stage Dockerfile for production deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t transcribo-frontend .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 transcribo-frontend
```

For a complete setup with backend services, use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services (frontend, backend, and AI models)
sudo docker compose --profile frontend up --build

# Start only backend services
sudo docker compose up --build
```
